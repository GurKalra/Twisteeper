===========================
  RULES BEFORE RUNNING
===========================

1. This game was made in Godot 4.4.
2. Itâ€™s a MINESWEEPER with a twist.
3. The board rotates 90Â° clockwise every 8 left-clicks.
4. Flagged tiles become "frozen" and do NOT rotate.
5. Only **left-clicks** (reveals) count toward the 8-click rotation trigger.
6. The UI is minimal â€” functional, not flashy.
7. No Godot installation is required for running builds.
8. Bugs may exist â€” this game was built in 2 days!
9. Avoid unflagging and reflagging the same cell repeatedly â€” it wonâ€™t break the game, but might behave oddly.
10. Most importantly: Have fun and twist your brain! ðŸŒ€
