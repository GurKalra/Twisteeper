===========================
 RULES BEFORE RUNNING
===========================

1. The game is made with Godot 4.4.
2. This is a MINESWEEPER game with a twist.
3. The board rotates 90Â° every 8 left-clicks.
4. Flagged tiles "lock" their layers and will not rotate.
5. Only left-clicking (reveal) counts toward the 8-click twist trigger.
6. UI is minimal â€” no flashy visuals, just function.
7. If you're playing a build, no Godot installation is needed.
8. Bugs may exist â€” it was built in 2 days.
9. Donâ€™t unflag and reflag â€” it wonâ€™t break, but itâ€™s weird.
10. Have fun and spin your brain ðŸ˜µ
